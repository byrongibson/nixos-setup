If you need to do this on linux:

rsync --preallocate /path/to/source/file /path/to/destination/

rysnc preallocates a contiguous block of storage and copies the file into it. Works for FAT too.

Just make sure the file does not already exist at the destination, or rsync won't reallocate and re-copy it. If it is, delete it, Empty Trash to make sure it's really gone, then run this command.

Verify if it copied contiguously:

filefrag /path/to/destination/file

"1 extent found" means the file is contiguous. More than one means it's fragmented.
